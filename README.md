# Community Health Care Access by Region

## Project Overiew
This project analyzes publicly available federal health center data to understand access to care across regions and health center types. The analysis focuses on data accuracy, aggregation validation, and clear communication of insights for non-technical stakeholders.

## Tools Used
- Excel (data cleaning, PivotTables, dashboards)
- SQL (aggregation, joins, validation)
- GitHub (version control and documentation)

## Key Questions
- How does access to community health care vary by region?
- Which health center types serve the largest patient populations?
- Are there geographic disparities in access?

## Process Summary
1. Cleaned and standardized raw data in Excel.
2. Used SQL queries to validate aggregations and ensure data integrity.
3. Built dashboards to summarize insights for stakeholders.
4. Documented analysis for reproducibility.
